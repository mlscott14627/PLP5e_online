The ubiquity of computers in everyday life in the 21st century justifies
the centrality of programming languages to computer science
education.&nbsp;
<em>Programming languages</em> is the area that connects the theoretical
foundations of computer science, the source of problem-solving algorithms,
to modern computer architectures on which the corresponding programs
produce solutions.&nbsp;  Given the speed with which computing technology
advances in this post-Internet era, a computing textbook must present a
structure for organizing information about a subject, not just the facts
of the subject itself.&nbsp;  In this book, Michael Scott broadly and
comprehensively presents the key concepts of programming languages and
their implementation, in a manner appropriate for computer science majors.&nbsp;
<p>
The key strength of Scott&rsquo;s book is that he holistically combines
descriptions of language concepts with concrete explanations of how to
realize them.&nbsp;  The depth of these discussions, which have been updated in
this third edition to reflect current research and practice, provide basic
information as well as supplemental material for the reader interested in
a specific topic.&nbsp;  By eliding some topics selectively, the instructor can
still create a coherent exploration of a subset of the subject matter.&nbsp;
Moreover, Scott uses numerous examples from real languages to illustrate
key points.&nbsp;  For interested or motivated readers, additional in-depth and
advanced discussions and exercises are available on the book&rsquo;s companion
CD, enabling students with a range of interests and abilities to further
explore on their own the fundamentals of programming languages and compilation.&nbsp;
<p>
I have taught a semester-long comparative programming languages course
using Scott&rsquo;s book for the last several years.&nbsp;  I emphasize to students
that my goal is for them to learn how to learn a programming language,
rather than to retain detailed specifics of any one programming
language.&nbsp;  The purpose of the course is to teach students an
organizational framework for learning new languages throughout their
careers, a certainty in the computer science science field.&nbsp;  To this end,
I particularly like Scott&rsquo;s chapters on programming language paradigms
(i.e., functional, logic, object-oriented, scripting), and my course
material is organized in this manner.&nbsp;  However, I also have included
foundational topics such as memory organization, names and locations,
scoping, types, and garbage collection&mdash;all of which benefit from
being presented in a manner that links the language concept to its
implementation details.&nbsp;  Scott&rsquo;s explanations are to the point and
intuitive, with clear illustrations and good examples.&nbsp;  Often, discussions
are independent of previously presented material, making it easier to pick
and choose topics for the syllabus.&nbsp;  In addition, many supplemental
teaching materials are provided on the Web.&nbsp;
<p>
Of key interest to me in this new edition are the new Chapter 15 on
run-time environments and virtual machines (VMs), and the major update of
Chapter 12 on concurrency.&nbsp;  Given the current emphasis on virtualization,
including a chapter on VMs, such as Java&rsquo;s JVM and CLI, facilitates
student understanding of this important topic and explains how modern
languages achieve portability over many platforms.&nbsp;  The discussion of
dynamic compilation and binary translation provides a contrast to the
more traditional model of compilation presented earlier in the book.&nbsp;  It
is important that Scott includes this newer compilation technology so
that a student can better understand what is needed to support the newer
dynamic language features described.&nbsp;  Further, the discussions of symbolic
debugging and performance analysis demonstrate that programming language
and compiler technology pervade the software development cycle.&nbsp;
<p>
Besides these major changes, this edition features updated examples (e.g.,
in X86 code, in C rather than Pascal) and enhanced discussions in the
context of modern languages such as C#, Java 5, Python, and
Eiffel.&nbsp; Presenting examples in several programming languages helps
students understand that it is the underlying common concepts that are
important, not their syntactic differences.&nbsp;
<p>
In summary, Michael Scott&rsquo;s
book is an excellent treatment of programming languages and their
implementation.&nbsp; This new third edition provides a good reference for
students, to supplement materials presented in lectures.&nbsp; Several coherent
tracks through the textbook allow construction of several
&ldquo;flavors&rdquo; of
courses that cover much, but not all of the material.&nbsp; The presentation is
clear and comprehensive with language design and implementation
discussed together and supporting one another.&nbsp;
<p>
Congratulations to Michael
on a fine third edition of this wonderful book!&nbsp;
