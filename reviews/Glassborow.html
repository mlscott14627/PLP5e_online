Let me say straight out that I thoroughly enjoyed this book.  The 
author writes with more fluency than many of his academic 
colleagues.  An added bonus is that he understands that different 
languages have individual strengths and weaknesses.  He avoids inane 
comparisons so often made by writers who do not understand the 
difference between a language such as C++ with a large degree of 
static binding and ones such as Smalltalk with entirely dynamic 
binding.<p>
It is very difficult to summarise such a substantial and 
comprehensive book in the space that I allow myself.  The author has 
a wide-ranging knowledge of computer languages and draws on more 
than forty languages during the course of the book.  If you are the 
kind of person who is tempted to suggest new features for your 
language of choice, reading this book may make you more thoughtful.  
On the other hand you may find material to strengthen your criticism 
of what you consider to be weaknesses in the language you are being 
compelled (by your employer) to use.<p>
If you really have no influence (or, like to many, do not care) on 
the choice of computer language you use then you may prefer to 
remain ignorant by not reading this book but the rest will find that 
it opens their eyes to the wide potential that choice opens up.<p>
One problem with too many University Computer Science/Engineering 
degrees is the very limited exposure students have to computing 
languages.  Many courses are now being designed round a single 
language and graduates leave their university with a very narrow and 
often highly biased view of programming.  Academics often promote 
what they believe to be 'good' for you.  Look at the 1980's with 
Pascal being taught CS courses while the commercial world was often 
using C (that is not intended to be critical of either language).<p>
What we need is an educated workforce that understands the forces 
that drive different languages and so can use them more effectively.
If you are a student (particularly if your course only covers one or 
two languages) make an effort to read this book (actually the book 
is easy to read, but student finances may make it hard to get a 
copy) because it will provide insights that most courses will fail 
to provide. <p>
If you have passed your student days, try to make time to read this 
book because I think it will deepen your understanding and help you 
to see why both language and methodology wars are such sterile 
pursuits.  When you understand the range of choice you will be 
better able to make decisions.  You will understand why writing 
Smalltalk in C++ does both languages a disservice.<p>
If you get the opportunity, read the back cover in your local 
bookshop.  For once I think the promises made are largely fulfilled. <p>
This is one book that I wish I had had the experience and breadth of 
knowledge to have written myself.
