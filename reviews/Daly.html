     This book is an excellent and highly detailed treatise on all the
     issues surrounding programming languages: theory, abstraction,
     syntax, semantics, implementation and so on. The emphasis is on
     software but hardware is not neglected: there is a detailed account
     of how they work together. The final chapters give sterling
     descriptions of object-orientation and multi-threaded programming.
     The chapters are neatly divided into an overview, detailed
     theoretical concepts and practical examples in many dialects, a
     summary, review questions, an exercise and bibliographical notes.
     The author is a senior academic, and his book can be used
     throughout a degree course.  The book handles compiled and
     interpreted languages. Examples are scattered throughout in well
     known languages - C, C++, Java, Pascal, Fortran, Modula, Perl - and
     less known ones: Scheme, Clu, Sisal.  Students will not find much
     use for this book after graduation, but for an understanding of
     programming language pragmatics, it is in a class of its own.
