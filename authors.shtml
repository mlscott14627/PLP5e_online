<p>
<a href="https://www.cs.rochester.edu/u/scott/"><big><b>Michael
L. Scott</big></b></a>&nbsp;
is the Arthur Gould Yates Professor of Engineering and Chair
of the <a href="/">Department of Computer Science</a> at the
<a href="http://www.rochester.edu">University of Rochester</a>.&nbsp;
He received his Ph.D. in computer sciences in 1985 from the
<a href="https://www.cs.wisc.edu">University of
Wisconsin&#8211;Madison</a>.&nbsp;
From 2014&ndash;2015 he was a Visiting Scientist at Google.&nbsp;
His research interests lie at the
intersection of programming languages, operating systems, and high-level
computer architecture, with an emphasis on parallel and distributed
computing.&nbsp;
His MCS mutual exclusion lock,
codesigned with <a href="https://cs.rice.edu/~johnmc/">John
Mellor-Crummey</a>, is used in a variety of commercial
and academic systems.&nbsp; Several other algorithms, co-designed with
<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/maged-michael-bab1138a/">Maged Michael</a>,
<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/bill-scherer-904798154/">Bill Scherer</a>,
and <a href="https://gee.cs.oswego.edu/dl/">Doug Lea</a>,
appear in the <code>java.util.concurrent</code>
standard library.&nbsp;
In 2006 he and Dr. Mellor-Crummey shared the ACM SIGACT/SIGOPS Edsger
W. Dijkstra Prize in Distributed Computing.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
Dr. Scott is a Fellow of
the <a href="http://acm.org">Association for Computing Machinery</a>,
the <a href="http://ieee.org">Institute of Electrical and Electronics
Engineers</a>,
and the <a href="https://www.aaas.org/">American Association for the
Advancement of Science</a>.&nbsp;
He received the University of Rochester&rsauo;s Robert and Pamela Goergen
Award for Distinguished Achievement and Artistry in Undergraduate
Teaching in 2001 and its William H.&nbsp;Riker Award for Graduate Teaching in
2020.&nbsp; In 2018 he received the Lifetime Achievement Award of the Hajim
School of Engineering and Applied Sciences.&nbsp;

<a href="https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~aldrich/"><big><b>Jonathan
Aldrich</big></b></a>&nbsp;
is a Professor of Computer Science at Carnegie Mellon University.&nbsp;
He received his Ph.D. in Computer Science and Engineering in 2003 from
the University of Washington.&nbsp;
His research centers on programming languages and type systems that are
deeply informed by software engineering considerations.&nbsp;
His research contributions include modular and gradual verification of
functional properties, typestate, and architectural structure, as well
as the design of languages and type systems for usability.&nbsp;
In 2007 he received the Dahl-Nygaard Junior Prize, given for
contributions to work on object orientation.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
Aldrich directed Carnegie Mellon&rsquo;s Ph.D. program in software
engineering from 2013 to 2019.&nbsp;
He has served as a program chair of programming language conferences
such as OOPSLA and ECOOP, as well as general chair and steering
committee chair of SPLASH.&nbsp;
Outside the university, Aldrich is the CTO of
<a href="https://www.noteful.net/welcome">Noteful</a>, a startup
building an educational app for music theory and note reading.
