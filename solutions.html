  Elsevier has still not managed to update this page correctly, and we

<!--
  <p>
  <b><big><big>A plea from the authors:</big></big></b>&nbsp; Please do not post
  solutions online, and please take precautions to protect the integrity
  of password protected sites.&nbsp; Students routinely search the
  Internet for answers to homework exercises from other
  instructors&#8217; websites.&nbsp; Please respect the need to restrict
  access to this material and take adequate precautions to prevent
  access to solutions by students not in your own courses.&nbsp;
